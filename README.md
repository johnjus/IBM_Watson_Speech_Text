# IBM_Watson_Speech_Text
Messing around with IBM Watson speech to text and text translation with python in the Visual Studio Code IDE

The program utilizes IBM Watson's speech to text and text translation APIs which are located on the IBM cloud.

The API keys which I used to access the APIS have been removed. Since they are unique codes to my IBM cloud account. The URL's which point to the end point for the APIs have also been removed. Both the API key's and URL endpoints can be obtain through an IBM cloud account.
